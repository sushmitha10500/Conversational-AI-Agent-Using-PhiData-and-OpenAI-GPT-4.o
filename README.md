🤖 Conversational AI Agent with PhiData and GPT-4.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Objective:
--------------
This project demonstrates the creation of a stateful conversational agent using the PhiData framework combined with OpenAI’s GPT-4o model. The agent is designed to respond to user inputs intelligently, with optional memory, markdown support, and system-level instructions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🚀 Overview
---------------
The AI agent leverages the PhiData Agent API and OpenAIChat wrapper to provide seamless interactions with GPT-4o. The agent supports:

Instruction customization

Streaming responses

Conversation history

Markdown-formatted outputs

Tool call visibility (for tracing)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Architecture & Pipeline:
----------------------------------------------
🔷 Agent Creation:
The agent is instantiated using phi.agent.Agent, with the underlying model set as OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"). This acts as the LLM engine.

🔷 Instruction Tuning:
System instructions are added during agent creation to define the assistant’s behavior. 
Examples:

“Answer concisely.”

“Respond as a professional tutor.”

This aligns with prompt engineering best practices.

🔷 Stateful Memory:
The agent supports memory by enabling:

add_history_to_messages=True: retains previous message threads

num_history_responses=n: defines how many past turns to include in context

This mimics multi-turn conversations like in real-world chatbots or assistants.

🔷 Markdown Rendering:
With markdown=True, responses are automatically formatted (e.g., bold, lists, code blocks), improving readability and UI display.

🔷 Response Streaming:
Using stream=True, the agent can stream tokens as they’re generated, ideal for real-time UIs or terminal-based chat apps.

| **LlamaIndex**                           | A data framework that connects LLMs with external data (PDFs, APIs, SQL, etc.).                                 |
| **Vector Index**                         | An index built on embedding vectors, enabling semantic search based on meaning, not just words.                 |
| **Embedding**                            | A numerical representation of text that preserves semantic meaning.                                             |
| **Semantic Search**                      | A method to find text/data that is semantically similar, even if not exact keyword matches.                     |
| **Query Engine**                         | Component responsible for processing user queries and retrieving the most relevant data chunks.                 |
| **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** | Technique where external data (retrieved via search) is fed to an LLM to generate accurate, grounded responses. |
